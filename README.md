# What is it?
Kin Improvement Proposal (KIP) - a proposed change to the Kin protocol. These proposals over time should become ubiquitus to changes to Kin itself.  Think of submissions as a change to Kin.  This could be anything the protocol touches or extension to the protocol to support more uses.  This could be anything from treasury expenses to KRE proposals.  The protocol's job is to execute whatever proposal enters.  With this in mind, the job of the reviewers of proposals is to ensure it has enough information that it can be executed on.
